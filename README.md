# Pancreatic Tumor Detection System

This project uses machine learning and image processing to detect pancreatic tumors from grayscale CT scan images. It combines medical imaging techniques with classification algorithms to support early diagnosis.

##  Features
- Image enhancement using **CLAHE** (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
- Feature extraction using **GLCM**, **Wavelet Transform**, and shape descriptors
- Dimensionality reduction using **PCA**
- Class imbalance handled with **SMOTE**
- Trained using **RBF-SVM** and **XGBoost**
- Deployed as a real-time prediction system using **Flask**
